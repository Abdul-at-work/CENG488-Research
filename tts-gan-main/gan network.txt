Generator class:

This class is responsible for creating the Generator part of the GAN. It inherits from the nn.Module class from the PyTorch library.
It has several hyperparameters, such as sequence length, patch size, channels, latent dimensions, embedding dimensions, depth, and dropout rates.
The __init__ method sets up the architecture for the generator, which includes a linear layer, positional embedding, and a series of TransformerEncoderBlocks. It also has a deconvolution layer for generating the output.
The forward method defines the forward pass for the generator. It takes a noise tensor z as input and passes it through the linear layer, positional embedding, TransformerEncoderBlocks, and finally the deconvolution layer to generate the output.

MultiHeadAttention class:

This class implements the multi-head self-attention mechanism used in the Transformer architecture. It inherits from the nn.Module class from PyTorch.
The forward method takes a tensor x and an optional mask as input, calculates the queries, keys, and values, and then computes the attention and final output.
ResidualAdd class:

This class implements the residual connections used in the Transformer architecture. It inherits from the nn.Module class from PyTorch.
The forward method takes an input tensor x and applies the specified function fn, then adds the result to the original input tensor x.

Discriminator class:

This class is responsible for creating the Discriminator part of the GAN. It inherits from the nn.Sequential class from the PyTorch library.
It has several hyperparameters, such as input channels, patch size, embedding dimensions, sequence



This implementation utilizes the Transformer architecture within the GAN framework by incorporating Transformer-based components in both the Generator and the Discriminator. Here is how the two parts are connected:

Generator:

The Generator utilizes a TransformerEncoder to generate meaningful feature representations from the input noise tensor (latent space). This is done by first converting the noise tensor into a sequence of embeddings using a linear layer, and then adding positional embeddings to provide positional information.
This sequence of embeddings is then passed through a stack of Gen_TransformerEncoderBlocks (TransformerEncoder) which contain multi-head self-attention and feed-forward layers. The output of this stack captures complex patterns in the latent space and creates a more structured representation.
The output from the TransformerEncoder is then reshaped and passed through a deconvolution layer to generate the final output, which is an image or a spectrogram, depending on the application.
Discriminator:

The Discriminator employs a TransformerEncoder to process and classify the input data, which can be either real or generated by the Generator. The input is first converted into a sequence of patch embeddings using PatchEmbedding_Linear. It achieves this by rearranging and projecting the input data into a lower-dimensional space.
The sequence of patch embeddings is then passed through a stack of Dis_TransformerEncoderBlocks (TransformerEncoder), which contain multi-head self-attention and feed-forward layers similar to the Generator's TransformerEncoder. This stack learns to discriminate between real and generated data by capturing the relevant features from the input.
The output of the TransformerEncoder is then processed by the ClassificationHead, which computes the mean of the embeddings, applies layer normalization, and a linear layer to produce the final output. This output represents the probability of the input data being real or generated.
In summary, the GAN architecture is implemented with Transformer components by using TransformerEncoder in both the Generator and Discriminator. The Generator learns to generate meaningful representations from the input noise using the TransformerEncoder, while the Discriminator learns to distinguish between real and generated data by processing the input through its own TransformerEncoder. This combination allows the GAN to learn complex patterns and produce high-quality outputs.
